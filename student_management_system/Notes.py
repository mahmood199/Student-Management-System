# Retrieve a course
# course = Course.objects.get(name='btech')
#
# Retrieve sessions for the course
# sessions = course.session_set.all()
#
# Iterate over the sessions
# for session in sessions:
#    print(session.session_start, session.session_end)
#
# This code retrieves the "btech" course,
# and then accesses all the sessions associated
# with that course using the reverse relation session_set.
# You can then perform any required operations on the sessions.
